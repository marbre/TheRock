"""Runs the hipThreads lit test suite against pre-built TheRock artifacts.

Unlike libhipcxx (which re-runs CMake + a ci/ shell script), hipThreads ships a
self-contained lit suite driven entirely by environment variables (see the
hipThreads test/lit.cfg). This script:

  1. Points lit at the test sources packaged in the `test` artifact
     (OUTPUT_ARTIFACTS_DIR/hipthreads, produced by HIPTHREADS_COPY_TO_BUILD).
  2. Makes the pre-built static library (libhipthreads.a / hipthreads.lib)
     discoverable at the
     `<HIPTHREADS_BUILD_DIR>/lib` path that lit.cfg's link flags expect.
  3. Invokes lit directly.
