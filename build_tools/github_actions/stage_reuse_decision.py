"""Auto-compute per-stage rebuild/reuse decisions for multi-arch CI.

This module decides, per build stage, whether the stage can be satisfied with
prebuilt artifacts (reuse) instead of being rebuilt. It reuses the existing
``stage_impact`` and ``baseline_runs`` tooling and adds two gates before a stage
is reported reusable:

* Impact gate (``stage_impact.analyze_stage_impact``) - the change does not
  affect the stage, so it is a *candidate* for reuse.
* Availability gate (``baseline_runs.select_baseline_run``) - a single healthy,
  commit-compatible baseline run actually contains the artifacts that stage
  would produce, verified independently for every platform being built.

Mode switch
-----------
The module is wired into CI behind a two-way ``STAGE_REUSE_MODE`` switch so it
can be observed before it changes anything:

* ``dry-run``    - DEFAULT. Compute the analysis and LOG, for each stage that
                   *would* be reused, a line to the console + step summary, but
                   return NO auto stages, so ``prebuilt_stages`` is unchanged
                   and every stage still builds exactly.
* ``reuse-stage`` - Compute the analysis and actually return the reuse stages so
                     the orchestrator copies their artifacts and skips the build.

Note: this ``STAGE_REUSE_MODE`` switch drives the *automatic* detection layer.
It is orthogonal to the ``prebuilt_stages`` workflow input, which is the
explicit, manual list of stages to reuse and is always honored regardless of
mode.

Environment Variables
--------------------
``_default_baseline_selector`` reads the following environment variables. These
are set by ``setup_multi_arch.yml`` and form the stage-reuse interface:

* ``STAGE_REUSE_MODE``           - ``dry-run`` (default) or ``reuse-stage``.
* ``GITHUB_REPOSITORY``          - ``owner/repo`` (default ``ROCm/TheRock``).
* ``STAGE_REUSE_BASELINE_BRANCH``  - baseline branch to search (default ``main``).
* ``STAGE_REUSE_BASELINE_WORKFLOW`` - baseline workflow file
                                   (default ``multi_arch_ci.yml``).
* ``STAGE_REUSE_CURRENT_SHA``    - current commit SHA; enables the
                                   commit-compatibility rule when set.
* ``STAGE_REUSE_MAX_AGE_HOURS``  - recency window in hours; disables the recency
                                   rule when unset.
* ``STAGE_REUSE_COMMIT_HISTORY`` - number of branch commits to fetch for
                                   ancestry (default ``50``).
