"""Tests validating workflow permissions for reusable workflow calls.

Workflows calling reusable workflows must have at least the permissions
declared by the callee. GitHub's permission model only allows permissions
to be downgraded (not elevated) in nested workflows.

This test validates that all transitive callers of reusable workflows
have the required permissions declared by those callees.
