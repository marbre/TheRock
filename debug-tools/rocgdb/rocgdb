# ROCgdb wrapper script
#
# This script selects and launches an appropriate ROCgdb executable based on
# the active Python version. It tries the Python-matching rocgdb binary first,
# falls back to other Python-enabled binaries, and finally to the Python-less
# version. It also configures TERMINFO for ncurses TUI mode.
#
# Debugging output can be enabled by setting ROCGDB_WRAPPER_DEBUG=1. The wrapper
# will run through the logic but not actually execute rocgdb, like a dry run.
#
# This mode is for debugging purposes only. The launcher outputs its searching
# logic so it is clear what particular rocgdb executable is being picked and
# why.

# Handle debugging output. Always disabled unless ROCGDB_WRAPPER_DEBUG is set to 1.
