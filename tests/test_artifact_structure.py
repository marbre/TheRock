"""Structural validation of artifact archives.

These tests scan artifact archives WITHOUT extracting them and check invariants
that the build system should maintain. They run on CPU (no GPU required) and
are designed to catch issues before artifacts are installed or tested on GPU
runners.

Tests:
  - Cross-artifact overlaps: no two artifacts should produce files that
    flatten to the same path (causes silent overwrites or race conditions,
    see https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/issues/3758).
  - Within-artifact component overlaps: different components (lib, run,
    test, etc.) of the same artifact should contain disjoint files (the
    component scanner should enforce this via the extends chain).
  - Manifest validation: every archive should have artifact_manifest.txt
    as its first member.
  - Package coverage: every artifact/component present in the fetched
    archives should be covered by a Linux package definition in
    build_tools/packaging/linux/package.json.

Usage:
    THEROCK_ARTIFACTS_DIR=/path/to/archives \\
        python -m pytest tests/test_artifact_structure.py -v --log-cli-level=info

THEROCK_ARTIFACTS_DIR should point to a directory containing artifact archives
(*.tar.zst or *.tar.xz) as produced by the build pipeline.
